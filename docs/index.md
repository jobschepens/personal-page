# Welcome

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the **UniversitÃ¤t zu KÃ¶ln**, Center for Digital Humanities. Half of the time, I work for the SFB1252: Prominence in Language as a Service Project member focusing on research data and methods. The other half, I work for the Key Profile Area: Skills and Structures in Language and Cognition, where I focus on a research project on using LLMs for Word Frequency estimations. Generally, my research focuses on **linguistic distance**, **transfer learning**, and **computational modeling** in language learning and processing.

Since I received my PhD in 2015 from Radboud University Nijmegen, I have contributed to projects at institutions including TU Dortmund, Freie UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, and the Max Planck Institute for Human Development, Berlin.

## Research Interests

- Linguistic similarity and its impact on adult language learning
- Computational approaches to language processing
- Educational research and data science in linguistics
- Large Language Models in psycholinguistics
