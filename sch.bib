We show that linguistic distances between speakers’ first (L1) and second (L2) languages and their third (L3) language play a role. Larger distances from the L1 to the L3 and from the L2 to the L3 correlate with lower degrees of L3 learnability. The evidence comes from L3 Dutch speaking proficiency test scores obtained by candidates who speak a diverse set of L1s and L2s. Lexical and morphological distances between the L1s of the learners and Dutch explained 47.7\% of the variation in proficiency scores. Lexical and morphological distances between the L2s of the learners and Dutch explained 32.4\% of the variation in proficiency scores in multilingual learners. Cross-linguistic differences require language learners to bridge varying linguistic gaps between their L1 and L2 competences and the target language.},

We show that instead of a discontinuous exponential learning with sigmoidal decay (ELSD) model, a continuous ELSD model had a better fit when applied separately to monolinguals, bilinguals, and early immersion learners. Only for nonimmersion learners and later immersion learners did a discontinuous ELSD model have a better fit, with a critical age of 18.6 and 19.0 years of age, respectively. These age effects can be interpreted as schooling effects. We suggest that personal and societal factors, including differences in living circumstances and socialization, may bring about age-specific discontinuity patterns in language learning and in language learning rate. The implication is that they are not the outcome of cognition-driven developmental factors leading to one or more critical periods.},

	abstract = {Certain first languages (L1) seem to impede the acquisition of a specific L2 more than other L1s do. This study investigates to what extent different L1s have an impact on the proficiency levels attained in L2 Dutch (Dutch L2 learnability). Our hypothesis is that the varying effects across the L1s are explainable by morphological similarity patterns between the L1s and L2 Dutch. Correlational analyses on typologically defined morphological differences between 49 L1s and L2 Dutch show that L2 learnability co-varies systematically with similarities in morphological features. We investigate a set of 28 morphological features, looking both at individual features and the total set of features. We then divide the differences in features into a class of increasing and a class of decreasing morphological complexity. It turns out that observed Dutch L2 proficiency correlates more strongly with features based on increasing morphological complexity (r = -.67, p {\textless} .0001) than with features based on decreasing morphological complexity (r = -.45, p {\textless} .005). Degree of similarity matters (r = -.77, p {\textless} .0001), but increasing complexity seems to be the decisive property in establishing L2 learnability. Our findings may offer a better understanding of L2 learnability and of the different proficiency levels of L2 speakers. L2 learnability and L2 proficiency co-vary in terms of the morphological make-up of the mother tongue and the second language to be learned.},

Regression models that contain such group-specific random effects are called mixed-effects regression models, or simply mixed models. Mixed models are a versatile tool that can handle both balanced and unbalanced datasets and that can also be applied when several layers of grouping are present in the data; these layers can either be nested or crossed. In linguistics, as in many other fields, the use of mixed models has gained ground rapidly over the last decade. This methodological evolution enables us to build more sophisticated and arguably more realistic models, but, due to its technical complexity, also introduces new challenges. This volume brings together a number of promising new evolutions in the use of mixed models in linguistics, but also addresses a number of common complications, misunderstandings, and pitfalls. Topics that are covered include the use of huge datasets, dealing with non-linear relations, issues of cross-validation, and issues of model selection and complex random structures. The volume features examples from various subfields in linguistics. The book also provides R code for a wide range of analyses.},

This exam is officially administred by the Board of Tests and Examinations (College voor Toetsen en Examens, or CvTE). See cvte.nl/about-cvte. The Board of Tests and Examinations is mandated by the Dutch government. The article accompanying the dataset: Schepens, J., van Hout, R., Jaeger, T.F. (in press). Big data suggest strong constraints of linguistic similarity on adult language learning. Cognition.   Every row in the dataset represents the first official testing score of a unique learner. The columns contain the following information as based on questionnaires filled in at the time of the exam: "L1" - The first language of the learner "C" - The country of birth "L1L2" - The combination of first and best additional language besides Dutch "L2" - The best additional language besides Dutch "AaA" - Age at Arrival in the Netherlands in years (starting date of residence) "LoR" - Length of residence in the Netherlands in years "Edu.day" - Duration of daily education (1 low, 2 middle, 3 high, 4 very high). From 1992 until 2006, learners' education has been measured by means of a side-by-side matrix question in a learner's questionnaire. Learners were asked to mark which type of education they have had (elementary, secondary, or tertiary schooling) by means of filling in for how many years they have been enrolled, in which country, and whether or not they have graduated. Based on this information we were able to estimate how many years learners have had education on a daily basis from six years of age onwards. Since 2006, the question about learners' education has been altered and it is asked directly how many years learners have had formal education on a daily basis from six years of age onwards. Possible answering categories are: 1) 0 thru 5 years; 2) 6 thru 10 years; 3) 11 thru 15 years; 4) 16 years or more. The answers have been merged into the categorical answer.

The World Bank reports on education data in a wide number of countries around the world on a regular basis.

These non-native variants (‘accents’) can have far-reaching socio-economic consequences for learners. Many factors have been found to contribute to a learners’ proficiency in the new language. Here we examine a factor that is outside of the control of the learner, linguistic similarities between the learner’s native language (L1) and the new language (Ln). We analyze the (open access) speaking proficiencies of about 50,000 Ln learners of Dutch with 62 diverse L1s. We find that a learner’s L1 accounts for 9–22\% of the variance in Ln speaking proficiency. This corresponds to 28–69\% of the variance explained by a model with controls for other factors known to affect language learning, such as education, age of acquisition and length of exposure. We also find that almost 80\% of the effect of L1 can be explained by combining measures of phonological, morphological, and lexical similarity between the L1 and the Ln. These results highlight the constraints that a learner’s native language imposes on language learning, and inform theories of L1-to-Ln transfer during Ln learning and use. As predicted by some proposals, we also find that L1-Ln phonological similarity is better captured when subcategorical properties (phonological features) are considered in the calculation of phonological similarities.},

	abstract = {Gender differences were analyzed across countries of origin and continents, and across mother tongues and language families, using a large-scale database, containing information on 27,119 adult learners of Dutch as a second language. Female learners consistently outperformed male learners in speaking and writing proficiency in Dutch as a second language. This gender gap remained remarkably robust and constant when other learner characteristics were taken into account, such as education, age of arrival, length of residence and hours studying Dutch. For reading and listening skills in Dutch, no gender gap was found. In addition, we found a general gender by education effect for all four language skills in Dutch for speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Female language learners turned out to profit more from higher educational training than male learners do in adult second language acquisition. These findings do not seem to match nurture-oriented explanatory frameworks based for instance on a human capital approach or gender-specific acculturation processes. Rather, they seem to corroborate a nature-based, gene-environment correlational framework in which language proficiency being a genetically-influenced ability interacting with environmental factors such as motivation, orientation, education, and learner strategies that still mediate between endowment and acquiring language proficiency at an adult stage.},

	url = {https://openreview.net/forum?id=hnFzGD36hC},
	abstract = {Head nod is one of the most commonly produced bodily signals in interaction, an up-and-down movement of the head, often repeated. Both signers/speakers as well as addressees produce head nods during face-to-face interaction. Head nod is associated with a number of different communicative functions in interaction such as affirmation, emphasis, affiliation, and feedback among other [1]. In sign language linguistics, head nods are recognized as aspectual or prosodic non-manual markers to signal clause and constituent boundaries and to mark phonological and intonational phrases in narratives [2], [3]. However, most claims about the phonetic properties of head nods have been based on manual annotation without reference to naturalistic text types and the head nods produced by the addressee have been largely ignored (with notable exception of the work by Pupponen and Mesch [4], [5]). We thus lack detailed information about the phonetic properties of addressee’s head nods and not much is known about whether linguistic functions of head nods influence their phonetic form. This study presents findings about the phonetic properties of the addressee’s head nods in natural dyadic signed and spoken interaction. The aim is to find out whether head nods serving different pragmatic functions in interaction vary in their phonetic/kinematic characteristics. We hypothesize that affirmation nods differ from feedback nods in both language modalities. We use the term ‘affirmation’ to describe somebody’s positive reaction to a preceding question. We define a nod as fulfilling the function of feedback, when it functions as an interactional behavior that displays interlocutors’ perception or understanding of the course of the conversation. We focus on the very common feedback mechanisms which can signal a non-uptake of a conversation turn, acknowledge a prior statement or demonstrate understanding of the information represented by another signer (aka continuers, backchannels, minimal responses) [5], [6]. To test the hypothesis, we combine manual annotation in ELAN with quantitative analysis of body pose information generated using the computer vision toolkit OpenPose [7] to extract head nod measurements from video recordings and examine head nods in terms of their duration, amplitude and velocity. The applicability of computer vision tools for phonetic analysis of non-manuals has been successfully tested for sign languages [8]. This study provides a cross-modal analysis of head nods. We use the publicly available data from the DGS (German Sign Language) Corpus [9] and newly collected multimodal data from spoken German conversations. We investigate ca. 4 hours of naturalistic dyadic interaction per each language and identify more than 600 occurrences of nods in each dataset. While the quantitative data analysis for spoken German is still ongoing, our DGS results show that phonetic properties of affirmative nods differ from those of feedback nods in velocity and maximal amplitude. Feedback nods appear to be on average slower in production and smaller in amplitude than affirmation nods. We attribute the variation in phonetic properties of head nods to the distinct roles these cues fulfill in the turn-taking system (feedback nods are usually passive recipiency signals and affirmation nods signal turn initiation). Our preliminary results reveal no cross-modal differences in phonetic characteristics of addressee’s head nods. Figure 1: Visualization of head nods. The source video (left) is overlaid with the OpenPose body points used for the calculations. On the line graph (upper right) the upper (blue) line represents the vertical motion of the nose relative to body position, while the lower (red) line indicates the nose location prediction confidence of OpenPose (worse during blur or when occluded). Light blue boxes indicate durations manually labeled as head nods. The spectrogram (lower right) visualizes the spectrum of frequencies of vertical nose movement, with brighter areas indicating repeated up and down motion as during nodding. References (see PDF)},

The integration of ML allows researchers to gain richer insights from multimodal data, enabling a deeper understanding of human (and non-human) communication across modalities. In particular, augmentation methods have become indispensable because they facilitate the synthesis of multimodal data and further increase the diversity and richness of training datasets. In addition, ML-based tools have accelerated annotation processes, reducing human effort while improving accuracy.},

	abstract = {This study investigates head nods in natural dyadic German Sign Language (DGS) interaction, with the aim of finding whether head nods serving different functions vary in their phonetic characteristics. Earlier research on spoken and sign language interaction has revealed that head nods vary in the form of the movement. However, most claims about the phonetic properties of head nods have been based on manual annotation without reference to naturalistic text types and the head nods produced by the addressee have been largely ignored. There is a lack of detailed information about the phonetic properties of the addressee’s head nods and their interaction with manual cues in DGS as well as in other sign languages, and the existence of a form-function relationship of head nods remains uncertain. We hypothesize that head nods functioning in the context of affirmation differ from those signaling feedback in their form and the co-occurrence with manual items. To test the hypothesis, we apply OpenPose, a computer vision toolkit, to extract head nod measurements from video recordings and examine head nods in terms of their duration, amplitude and velocity. We describe the basic phonetic properties of head nods in DGS and their interaction with manual items in naturalistic corpus data. Our results show that phonetic properties of affirmative nods differ from those of feedback nods. Feedback nods appear to be on average slower in production and smaller in amplitude than affirmation nods, and they are commonly produced without a co-occurring manual element. We attribute the variations in phonetic properties to the distinct roles these cues fulfill in turn-taking system. This research underlines the importance of non-manual cues in shaping the turn-taking system of sign languages, establishing the links between such research fields as sign language linguistics, conversational analysis, quantitative linguistics and computer vision.},
